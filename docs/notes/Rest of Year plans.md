## Near-term steps
- **Documentation and commenting**
	- potential to add members to project
	- might be a while before I look at it again
- Get power curve
	- FFT computes over a time period to get power density distribution
	- **research maximum entropy method** (MEM)
		- may be easier/better than FFT
		- *methods and results* section of the [[shiraishi-et-al-real-time-analysis-of-the-heart-rate-variability-during-incremental-exercise-for-the-detection-of-the.pdf|article]]
- integrate under curve with bounds for low and high freqency
- Get LF/HF ratio
	- Rolling 60 second conditions met $\rightarrow$ stimulation
	- A ratio between low freq and high freq should normalize inherently, but for conditions that must be met by just high freqency, may still need to normalize values somehow...

## Notes for later:
- Have a design meeting
	- need potential users input
- Better user interface ideas
	- screen
	- led indicators (in enclosure, not on board)
		- power status
		- bluetooth status
		- stim on/off
	- buttons for input (retry connection, navigate menus, manual stim)
	- switches (stim on/off, device on/off)
	- connection on startup auto-retry if device not found
		- configuration for device type/name
	- enclosure & pcbs
		- battery power + charging + indicators
	- SD card integration for logging?
- run reliability tests on BLE connection
	- what if it drops?
	- what is its range?
- how long can the polar last on a charge? esp should last just as long
	- measure power draw to calculate battery size needed
- motor integration to interface with stimulation device
- investigate sources of PP-Error
	- device cites movement?
	- light leak?
		- wrap the device?
	- device placement (where on the arm, or leg)
	- get acceleration data from device too and graph *acceleration vs error* to see correlation
